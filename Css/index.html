            <p>Most content on the web is text-based, so you will find yourself needing to work with HTML text elements quite a bit.</p>
            <p>In this lesson, we will learn about the text-based elements you are likely to use the most.</p>

        <div><h3>Paragraphs</h3></div>
        <p>What would you expect the following text to output on an HTML page</p>
        <img src="scrn1.png" alt="Some instructions">
        <p>It looks like two paragraphs of text, and so you might expect it to display in that way. However that is not the case, as you can see in the output below:</p>
        <img class="img2" src="scrn2.png" alt="Some instructions 2">
        <p>When the browser encounters new lines like this in your HTML, it will compress them down into one single space. The result of this compression is that all of the text is clumped together into one long line.</p>
        <p>If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph element, which will add a newline after each of our paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a &lt;p&gt; tag</p>
        <p>Changing our example from before to use paragraph elements fixes the issue:</p>
        <img src="scrn3.png" alt="Some instructions 3">
        <h3>headings</h3>
        <p>Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.</p>
        <p>There are 6 different levels of headings starting from &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;. The number within a heading tag represents that heading's level. The largest and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest heading at the lowest level.</p>
        <p>Headings are defined much like paragraphs. For example, to create an h1 heading, we wrap our heading text in a &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
