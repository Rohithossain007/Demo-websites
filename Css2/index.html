            <p>In the previous lesson, you learned how to write the HTML that determines how a web page is structured. The next step is to make that structure look good with some style, which is exactly what CSS is for. In this lesson, we’re going to focus on what we believe are some foundational CSS concepts, things that everyone should know from the beginning — whether they are just starting out or simply need a refresher.</p>

            <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
            <p>At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selector (more on this in a bit) and a semi-colon separated list of declarations, with each of those declarations being made up of a property:value pair.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p> &lt;div&gt; is one of the basic HTML elements. It is simply an empty container. In general, it is best to use other tags such as &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&lt; for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you'll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements. Many of our exercises use plain &lt;div&gt;s for simplicity. Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="selectors">
            <h2>
                Selectors
            </h2>
            <p>
                Selectors simply refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're what is actually being “selected” for each rule. The following subsections don't cover every selector available, but they're by far the most common and the ones you should get comfortable using first.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="uni-selector">
            <h3>
                Universal selector
            </h3>
            <p>
                The universal selector will select elements of any type, hence the name “universal”, and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the <code class="change-color1">color; purple;</code> style applied to it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="uni-color">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    * {
                </li>
                <li>
                    color: purple;
                </li>
                <li>
                }
                </li>
            </ol>
